						<h2>Story</h2>
						<h1 class="bold">Don't worry, Orbit is here.</h1>
						<p class="intro bold">
							Connecting your home with time and space.
							Realigning your biological clock with nature.
						</p>
						<p>
							Orbit does more than just control your house. We give you a healthier, happier, more well-rested life thru our solarsystem.
							All you need to do is choose a mood, or state you want to achieve in our app, and your solarsystem does the rest.
						</p>
						<h3>Connecting to nature</h3>
						<p>
							In the stone age people took the days as they came. They used the sun, the moon and the stars as there alarm clock. We lived like this for a gazilion of years. Until the industrial revolution. We lost the connection with our natural clock. Putting stress levels, and burnout rates thru the roof. 
						</p>
						<p>
							With the current rise of all our smarthome gadgets. Orbit felt we were missing out on a lot of chances. Many players in the smarthome-market create pretty exciting stuff. The only part we think they are missing out, is putting it all together.
							Every brand has there own ecosystem and app. But when you want to put it all together, suddenly it gets really complicated.
							This is when Orbit comes into play. We made it possible to combine all those ecosystems in one Solarsystem.
						</p>
						<h3 class="bold">The Solarsystem</h3>
						<p>
							The Orbit solarsystem adjusts your home with the rhythm of nature and combines this with your profesional live.
							In the morning ,depending on your chosen mood, our Spherical lamp wakes you up with sunrise, singing birds, and the smell of coffee. This should get you going for a busy day at work. When you arrive home, our solarsystem was expecting you. It already turned on the heat, playing music and adjusted the lighting. Each factor adapted to the chosen mood. When the sun sets and it's almost time for a well deserved sleep our solarsystem will adapt. Preparing you for bedtime. Every screen in the house will dim. When you reached bedtime the screen will go blank, and stay blank until sunrise. This can all be adapted to specific family members. Your kids tablet will blank earlier than yours.
